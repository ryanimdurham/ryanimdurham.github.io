                        Innervisions is the sixteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter, and musician Stevie Wonder, released on August 3, 1973, by Tamla, a subsidiary of Motown Records. A landmark recording of Wonder's "classic period", the album has been regarded as completing his transition from the "Little Stevie Wonder" known for romantic ballads into a more musically mature, conscious, and grown-up artist.

                    4 is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Beyonc&eacute;. It was released on June 24, 2011, by Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Following a career hiatus which reignited her creativity, Beyonc&eacute; was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional rhythm and blues that stood apart from contemporary pop. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers The-Dream, Tricky Stewart and Shea Taylor produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from funk, hip hop, and soul music. Severing professional ties with father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyonc&eacute; eschewed the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. Lyrical themes of 4 emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyonc&eacute; considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyonc&eacute; submitted 72 songs to Columbia Records for consideration, 12 of which would appear on the standard edition.

                    "Awaken, My Love!" is the third studio album by American recording artist Donald Glover, under his stage name Childish Gambino. It was released by Glassnote Records on December 2, 2016. Consisting of tracks being sung rather than rapped, its fusion of psychedelic soul, funk and R&B influences was considered a bold departure from the predominantly hip hop style of his prior work. The album was produced by Glover and his longtime collaborator, Ludwig Göransson.
